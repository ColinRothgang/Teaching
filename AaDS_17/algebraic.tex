Algebraic data types are a not clearly delineated family of record types.
Typically one field of the record is a type, and the other fields are operations on that type.

Many of them represent mathematical theories, in which case their elements represent mathematical structures.
Therefore, they tend to come up a lot.
But their high level of abstraction leads to them often being overlooked.

Three classes are of major importance:
\begin{itemize}
% based on one operation, based on two operations, based on one relation
\item 
\end{itemize}


% matrix multiplication for any semi-ring? use for flow?
% fold for any monoid; +, *, min, max, concat,
