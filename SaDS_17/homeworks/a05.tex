\begin{problem}{Proof Assistants: Practice}{3}
Install either Isabelle or Coq (see the links in the lecture notes).

Write a simple pure recursive function and verify that it meets its specification using the tool.
Generate executable code from your function.
\medskip

Submit a reasonable combination of screen shots, shell logs, system output etc. that demonstrates you completed the task.

You may use any example that is already part of the available documentation or tutorials.
But you have to prove that you actually installed the system and ran the verification.
For example, you can copy an example from the tutorial, rename the function to your name, and then run the verification.
